          <h2>1. Voxraiths – The Swarm of Echoes</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Power:</strong> Soundwave Manipulation & Mind Disruption
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Population:</strong> Massive (Low individual strength but
              overwhelming numbers)
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Voxraiths are shadowy, neon-outlined specters that move in massive
            swarms, their bodies flickering between existence like living
            static. They communicate through distorted, high-frequency pulses,
            capable of disrupting enemy thoughts and causing hallucinations.
            While individually weak, their power grows exponentially when they
            resonate in groups, creating city-wide sonic explosions that can
            tear apart infrastructure and organic matter alike.
          </p>
          <strong>⚠️ Weakness:</strong> Their frequency can be disrupted by
          certain wavelengths of neon light, causing them to scatter.

          <h2>2. Drakmor – The Neon Juggernauts</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Power:</strong> Gravity Control & Devastating Strength
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Population:</strong> Very Rare (Each one is a walking
              catastrophe)
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The Drakmor are towering, cybernetic behemoths with crystalline
            exoskeletons infused with raw neon energy. Standing over 50 feet
            tall, these monsters possess immense gravitational control, allowing
            them to crush enemies under invisible force fields or create
            singularities that warp the battlefield. Their hulking bodies are
            nearly indestructible, absorbing energy attacks and unleashing it in
            neon eruptions.
          </p>
          <strong>⚠️ Weakness:</strong> Their power cores require time to
          recharge, leaving them vulnerable when depleted.

        <div class="creature-text">
          <h2>3. Nyxborn – Assassins of the Abyss</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Power:</strong> Phase-Shifting & Void Consumption</li>
            <li>
              <strong>Population:</strong> Moderate (Highly deadly but not
              numerous)
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Nyxborn are sleek, biomechanical assassins with elongated,
            featureless faces that pulse with neon runes. They can phase through
            matter, allowing them to slip past defenses and strike from any
            angle. Their most terrifying ability is Void Consumption—they absorb
            the energy of their victims, draining them until nothing remains but
            an empty husk. Nyxborn prefer to strike from the shadows,
            eliminating high-value targets before fading back into the darkness.
          </p>
          <strong>⚠️ Weakness:</strong> While nearly untouchable in their phase
          form, they must solidify to attack, making them vulnerable for brief
          moments.

        <img
          src="images/Kryz'Zhul.webp"

        <div class="creature-text">
          <h2>4. Kryz'Zhul – The Apex Tyrants</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Power:</strong> Neon Infernos & Reality Distortion</li>
            <li>
              <strong>Population:</strong> Extremely Rare (One Kryz’Zhul can
              level an entire city)
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The Kryz'Zhul are the true apex predators of Neon Abyss, existing at
            the pinnacle of power. They are titanic, winged horrors with molten
            neon coursing through their veins. Their very presence distorts
            reality, causing the air around them to shimmer and time to dilate
            unpredictably. Kryz’Zhul breathe superheated neon fire that
            disintegrates matter on contact, and they can bend light itself,
            making them nearly impossible to track.
          </p>
          <strong>⚠️ Weakness:</strong> Their immense power makes them
          unstable—if wounded, their energy can spiral out of control,
          potentially causing them to implode in a catastrophic neon explosion.
